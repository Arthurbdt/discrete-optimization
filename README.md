# Discrete optimization
Collection of algorithms to solve classic discrete optimization problems like knapsack and traveling salesman.

This repository uses contents (notably input files) from Coursera's Discrete Optimization class created by the University of Melbourne.

Each problem is solved with a different type of algorithm coded in Python. Such algorithms include branch and bound, genetic algorithm, simulated annealing etc.
